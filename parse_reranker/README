parse_reranker

Just to preface, I struggled mightily with this assignment! Hope to do better on
the next one. I apologize for some of the code being messy & potentially difficult to
"parse" as well. Train/Test times are all well about <5mins due to running these
programs on a personal desktop with a GPU.

The model completes training, but I was never able to achieve a loss on the
training data lower than arnd 5. Here are some comet.ml experiments:

GRU Training examples: (I varied the learning rate, num linear layers, batch_size, etc.)

Initially I was conflicted about whether to use whole length sequences as inputs
to the RNN, because of the large window size. My first approach then was to partition
an input sequence and use the final hidden state from a sequence partition as input
to the subsequent ones (had rnn_size = 30 for these).

When that didn't seem effective, I decided to change the window to the average length
of a single parse in training, which turned out to be 61 for this data. Switching
between GRU and LSTM did not change much either.

I can only conclude there must have been some issue with the way I was preprocessing
the data/creating inputs & labels. This definitely impacted the results I got from
testing as well....perplexity was suspiciously low around 1, and F1 recall, and
precision were terribly low as well. With more time, I would have tried training
with more than 1 epoch, but my intuition tells me the issue is not that the model
didn't train long enough
